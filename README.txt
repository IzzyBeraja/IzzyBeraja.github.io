Welcome to the README of my personal site!
I will be adding information about various versions and future changes I will be making here.
This is a work in-progress so things will be constantly changing!

Version 2
    TODO:
        -   Make things brighter and stand out more
            +   Reduce the mutedness of the previous version
        -   Highlight the following skills or work experiences:
            +   Work projects (SQL, C#, JS)
            +   Programming challenges (C#)
                -   Project Euler links in Github
            +   Financial knowledge (Financial projects, handling of documents and building tables)
            +   Medical knowledge (Information about MIPS, HIPAA, MACRA, AHCA, ICD-10, CPTs)
            +   Programming languages I'm learning (Python)
                -   Include interest in Git, DevOps, AI
            +   Implementations of software in company (ChaseData, VOIP, Automated reporting)
            +   Management of staff and information (Orchestrating sale)
        -   Less emphasis on personal information (cooking, 3d printing)
            +   Can still be there but should be more of a background thing (Maybe just at the bottom)
        -   Use more professional photos
            +   Especially personal photos that show big smiles
        -   Describe future endeavors and projects

Version 1
    TODO:
        -   Change fonts to better highlight myself
    Done:
        -   Added the basic template for the website
        -   Added a few items that describe me
        -   Created some animations for the initial loading
        -   Gained a greater understanding of CSS and HTML
        -   Understood commiting and pushing to GIT with terminal commands
        -   Learned the layout of Visual Studio Code
    Remarks:
        -   Website is a bit muted
        -   Does not appropriately highlight my skillsets
        -   Includes too much information that isn't relevant
        -   Does not translate to mobile very well
        -   Has some bugs with navigation bars
